##Flower Engine

Flower Engine is an experimental code base to try new code style and design decisions.

##Code Style

###Naming

The general guideline is a name meaning should be clear from context. In places where it
becomes dubious one should attach suffixes or prefixes. 

For nouns the order of words in a name should be reverse.

For actions the order is conventional.
